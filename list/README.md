## Health

### Tooth paste  

Dad recomends: brush with a baking soda toothpaste without fluoride or titanium dioxide, floss, then rinse with fluoride 30 minutes or more later, ideally right before going to bed. (Brushing often with fluoride causes stiff joints.) When practical, brush gently without fluoride after each meal or sweet drink (even I don't do this yet).  Use hot water to soften bristles first. Move an electric toothbrush in circular motions that pull and massage gums rather than push. Plaque in your teeth is the same as the plaque in your brain. All you have to do is break up the colonies when flossing nightly, don't over worry it. And advance along a long piece of floss, so you are not moving gunk from one tooth to the next.
